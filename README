Softing OPC UA-AnsiC-Stack
==========================


Main Features:

- windows and linux layers work with 32 and 64 bit O/S.
- linux implements full IPv6 support, windows only on server side.
- pki store implementation reworked to be more flexible.
- conformant with strict aliasing rules.
- enumeral values are checked on receive.
- https protocol reworked and now basically stable.
- negotiates tls1 to tls1_2, supports DHE protocols.
- tested with gcc's sanitizer asan, tsan and ubsan.

Note: there is a sample AnsiCServer but it is included as-is
and not fully supported.

Build the source package:

Windows: Open the Visual Studio Command Shell.
Make sure that perl is in the path.  Any perl will do, even cygwin.
Download and extract the latest openssl-1.0.1 source tar ball
to the root folder.
Then cd to the root folder and execute build_win32.bat or
build_win64.bat depending on your target architecture.
This will automatically build openssl, the OPC UA Stack and the
sample server.
Dependencies are not supported, it will always be a full build.

Linux: Open a terminal window.
Then cd to the root folder and execute: make -f linux_gcc.mak
This builds the BUILD_TARGET=release by default.
You can add BUILD_TARGET=debug to build debug binaries.
Dependencies and incremental builds are supported.
To force a full build use: make -f linux_gcc.mak clean all

Note: OpenSSL is not included, the VS-projects assume to find
the OpenSSL header files at ../include/win32/openssl or
at ../include/x64/openssl dependent on the selected Platform.
The OpenSSL import libraries are expected to be found
at ../OpenSSL/vs_lib/VSxxxx/dll/ or ../OpenSSL/vs_lib/VSxxxx/dll64.

Linux make files assume openssl to be installed from the
distribution.
