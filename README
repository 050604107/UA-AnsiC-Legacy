Softing OPC UA-AnsiC-Stack
==========================


Build the source package:

Windows: Open Stack/Stack_VSxxxx in Visual Studio and build

Linux: cd Stack && make -f linux_gcc.mak

Note: OpenSSL is not included, the VS-projects assume to find
the OpenSSL header files at ../include/win32/openssl or
at ../include/x64/openssl dependent on the selected Platform.
The OpenSSL import libraries are expected to be found
at ../OpenSSL/vs_lib/VSxxxx/dll/ or ../OpenSSL/vs_lib/VSxxxx/dll64.

Linux make files assume openssl to be installed from the
distribution.
